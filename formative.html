        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>These days the fedora is infamous. It was once the height of fashion, the pinnacle of style, a symbol of grace. 
            Modern times have not been kind to this garment, but I believe it is soon due a rebirth. With a rich past and promising 
            future, the fedora may soon become the staple of 21st century style.</p>

                <p><q>A fedora is a hat with a soft brim and indented crown. It is typically creased 
                    lengthwise down the crown and "pinched" near the front on both sides. Fedoras can also be 
                    creased with teardrop crowns, diamond crowns, center dents, and others, and the positioning 
                    of pinches can vary. The typical crown height is 4.5 inches (11 cm). The term fedora was in 
                    use as early as 1891. Its popularity soared, and eventually it eclipsed the similar-looking 
                    homburg.</q></p>

                <h2 class = "sectionHeader">A History</h2>
                <p>The word fedora was first used as the title of an 1882 play by Victorein Sardou. Princess 
                    Fedora Romanov, the heroine of the play, wore a center-creased, soft brimmed hat. It was 
                    adopted by the women&#39s rights movement as a symbol. After Edward, Prince of Wales started to 
                    wear them in 1924, it became popular among men for its stylishness and weather protection. 
                    During the Prohibition era of the United States, fedoras were associated with gangsters to 
                    create a &#39tough guy&#39 image. Indiana Jones re-popularized the fedora in the 1980s.</p>

            <h3 class= "subheading">Revival</h3>
                <p><q>On February 17th, 2009, the men's lifestyle blog Details published an article titled "Cool or Tool?: 
                    The Fedora," which urged readers to carefully consider incorporating a fedora into their outfits. 
                    On July 20th, Urban Dictionary user Ricky Torro submitted an entry for the word "fedorka," 
                    defining the term as a pejorative for a person attempting to be hip or trendy by wearing the fashion accessory.</q> </p>

                <h3 class= "subheading">Mockery</h3>
                <p>The shameful mockery of the fedora was initiated in the early 2010s, as it became what is known 
                    as a &#39meme&#39 across various online social media websites. Just as quickly as this garment has 
                    fallen into disrepute, I am convinced it can once again rise to the highest peaks of modern style.</p>

    <h3 class= "subheading">Fedora Tipping</h3>
    <p>An old and deeply respectful gesture, the tipping of oneâ€™s hat can express recognition or 
        acknowledgement between two persons. In this modern period, the action is now met with disdain, 
        I believe this to be a tragedy.</p>
